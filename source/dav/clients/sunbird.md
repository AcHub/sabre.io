title: Sunbird
type: client
---

Sunbird was once the stand-alone version of [Lightning][1]. The original
strategy for Sunbird and Lightning was to have both an standalone product,
as well as a plugin for [Thunderbird](/dav/client/thunderbird.md).

That idea has been abandoned, and Sunbird is no longer maintained. For that
reason we recommend people to go to Thunderbird / Lightning.

The original beta versions are still [available on the mozilla website][2]
though.
