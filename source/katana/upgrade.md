Before updating, it's highly recommended to make a backup of your installation
directory and database.

To update your sabre/katana to the latest version, grab the latest version
from [GitHub][1].

After that, you can simply unzip the archive and overwrite all existing files
and directories *except* the `data/` directory. If you overwrite your `data/`
directory, you will effectively delete all existing data.
