We just released sabre/dav 2.1.2.

This release fixes a problem with the migration script, which could cause
scheduling not to work for events that were created before upgrading to
2.1.

It also fixes a bug that caused freebusy requests to fail for people with
no calendars, and a small problem in the browser plugin.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
