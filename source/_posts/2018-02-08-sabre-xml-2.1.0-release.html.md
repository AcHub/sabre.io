We just released sabre/xml 2.1.0.

This release adds a `mixedContent` deserializer function, which might be useful if you're parsing HTML-like documents with elements that contain both text and other elements as siblings.

Upgrade sabre/xml by running:

    composer update sabre/xml

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
