We just released sabre/vobject 3.4.7.

This version contains a small bugfix related to recurrence rules and querying.

Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:

    composer update sabre/vobject

If this didn't upgrade you to 3.4.7, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:

    "sabre/vobject" : "~3.4"

Full changelog of this release can be found on [Github][1].
