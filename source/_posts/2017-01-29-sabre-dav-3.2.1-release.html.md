We just released sabre/dav 3.2.1. This release improves syncing large calendars
when using SQLite and adds a new feature that allows CardDAV clients to use
property-filters when requesting addressbooks (thanks @DeepDiver1975).

If you're a user of the zip distribution, this release also updates all the
dependencies so you get a number of bug fixes and performance improvements from
those too.

To upgrade sabre/http, make sure your `composer.json` requires "^3.2" for
sabre/dav and run `composer update`.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
