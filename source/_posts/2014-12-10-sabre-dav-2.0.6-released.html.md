We just released sabre/dav 2.0.6.

This release ships with a few classes that make it easier to be compatible
with both sabre/dav 2.0 and 2.1.

It also addresses an issue some people had with migration from 1.8.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
