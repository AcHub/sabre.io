We just released sabre/xml 2.0.0.  Just like the major sabre/uri and
sabre/event releases earlier, the main change is that we now require PHP 7
and use strict typing across the board.

For most people this upgrade should be seamless. The exception is if your
own code already opted-in to strict typing and you were sending incorrect
types to sabre/xml.
