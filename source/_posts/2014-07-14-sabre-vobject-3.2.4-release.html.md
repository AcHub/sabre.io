We just released sabre/vobject 3.2.4.

Conversion between vcard 3 and 4 has been improved, a workaround has been
added to deal with Yahoo's broken vcard generation and the CLI tool works
again on PHP 5.3.

Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:

    composer update sabre/vobject

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
