We just released sabre/dav 3.0.5. 

This release fixes an issue related to encoding URIs in responses to
`PROPFIND` requests. This was causing issues for Cyberduck in particular,
but we suspect that there might be others.

Updating is *highly* recommended.

Update sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
