We just released sabre/vobject 4.1.1.

This release fixes a number of bugs, especially in regards to validation. This
should solve a number of issues for sabre/dav 3.2 which now uses the validation
system for stricter checking input data.

Upgrade sabre/vobject by running:

    composer update sabre/vobject
