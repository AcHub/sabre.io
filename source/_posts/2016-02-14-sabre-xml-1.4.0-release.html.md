We just released sabre/xml 1.4.0. This release fixes a number of problems
related to serializing value objects, and in particular array properties.

We also introduced a BC break. Value objects with properties that are set
to null or empty arrays are now skipped, as we feel that this is a more
sane default. It could influence your xml output though, so if you use
value objects, keep a close eye on if this affects you.

Update sabre/xml by running:

    composer update sabre/xml

If that didn't update your sabre/xml, make sure you are requiring `^1.4.0` in
your `composer.json`.
