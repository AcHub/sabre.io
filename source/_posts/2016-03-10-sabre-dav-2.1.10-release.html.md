We just released sabre/dav 2.1.10. This release fixes a small issue with
cleaning up sync logs after deleting address books. This bug could in some
rare circumstances cause clients to not see some changes for (unrelated)
address books.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
