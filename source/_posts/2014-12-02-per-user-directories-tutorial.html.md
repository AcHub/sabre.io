A commonly asked question on the mailing list, is:

> How do I create private directories on a WebDAV server.

Doing this is not extremely obvious, and there are a few issues that people
quickly run into.

We've added a new [tutorial][1] to our website explaining a 'simple way' of doing this,
and also a more advanced way, using WebDAV-ACL.

Hopefully it's useful!
