A commonly asked question on the mailing list, is:

> How do I create private directories on a WebDAV server.

Doing this is not extremely obvious, and there are a few issues that people
quickly run into when attempting this.

We've added a new [tutorial][1] to our website specifically to explain this,
with both a 'simple way' of doing this, and a more advanced way, using
WebDAV-ACL.

Hopefully it's useful!
