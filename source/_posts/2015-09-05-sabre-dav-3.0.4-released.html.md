We just released sabre/dav 3.0.4 

This releases contains the following fixes:

* This release fixes an issue related to `MOVE` requests. If a `MOVE` request
  was going to overwrite an existing resource, but that move request was stopped
  by access control (or other plugins), the target resource would still be
  deleted.
* It fixes incorrectly encoding `PROPPATCH` xml bodies in the client.
* It also fixes deserializing errors in the client when properties were not
  found on the server.

Update sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
