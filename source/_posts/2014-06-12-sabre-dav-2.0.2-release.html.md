We just released sabre/dav 2.0.2.

Several bugs have been fixed in files from the `examples/` directory, and
more notably: the dependencies in the zip distribution have been updated,
which, among other things, fixes compatibility with PHP versions older than
5.4.14.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
