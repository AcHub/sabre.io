We just released version 1.0.0 of a new URI library. This library solves a
few common problems we've been having, or simply did not do well enough in
the past.

The library is super light-weight and just provides 5 functions. We hope
it's useful for other people aside from us, but we'll be adding this as a new
dependency to sabre/xml, sabre/http, sabre/dav and in the future sabre/vobject,
as they all do 'stuff' with URIs, and were not doing everything in the best
way possible.

Check out the [documentation][1] if you'd like to learn more.
