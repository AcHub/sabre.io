We just released sabre/uri 2.1.0 and 1.2.0. This release adds a new pure-php
fallback parser for uris to work around two problems with PHP's `parse_url()`,
which had trouble with uris that start with a `scheme:///` (triple-slash) and
relative uri containing an unencoded colon.

2.1.0 and 1.2.0 have an identical API, the only difference is that 2.1.0 uses
strict PHP 7 typehints and 1.2.0 supports older PHP versions.

To upgrade sabre/uri, make sure your `composer.json` requires "^2.1" for
sabre/uri and run `composer update`.
