We just released sabre/xml 1.1.0.

This version contains a bugfix that makes it better at detecting broken xml
and throwing appropriate exceptions. This change also enables the use of
RelaxNG or XSchema validation.

Upgrade sabre/xml by running:

    composer update sabre/xml

If this didn't upgrade you to 1.1.0, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:

    "sabre/xml" : "~1.1"

Full changelog of this release can be found on [Github][1].
