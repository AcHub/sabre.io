We just released sabre/xml 1.3. This release is a fairly big update from the
1.2 series. It's 100% backwards compatible, but adds a number of exciting
features:

The biggest is support for a new [Value Objects][2] feature. This new feature
makes it extremely easy to map between Simple PHP classes and XML elements.

Read more on the [documentation][2] page, or check out our
[Atom sample parser][3] for a working example.

In addition to that:

* It's now possible to specify custom serializers for specific PHP classes.
  This would allow you to for instance specify how a PHP `DateTime` object
  might be serialized, or in general separate your serializers from the
  classes they are serializing.
* Added new deserializer functions for common XML patterns: `keyValue`,
  `elements`, `repeatingElements`, `valueObject`.
* It's now possible to tell `Sabre\Xml\Service::expect` a list of possible
  expected XML root elements.
* Lots of small bugfixes.
* Major documentation updates.

The full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
