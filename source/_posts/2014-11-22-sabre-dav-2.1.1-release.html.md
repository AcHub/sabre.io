We just released sabre/dav 2.1.1. Upgrading is highly recommended.

Two new bugs were found and fixed quickly after the 2.1 release two days ago,
one related to the database migration process and one related to [iMip][3].

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
