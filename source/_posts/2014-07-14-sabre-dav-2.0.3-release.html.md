We just released sabre/dav 2.0.3.

A number of problems were found in the revamped browser plugin, related to
generating links, and for a number of people none of the css and images
would load due to incorrect CSP rules.

In addition we found out that the `TooMuchMatches` exception never worked
due to a fatal error, so while fixing that, we also took the opportunity to
change the name of the exception to `TooManyMatches`. Don't laugh.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
