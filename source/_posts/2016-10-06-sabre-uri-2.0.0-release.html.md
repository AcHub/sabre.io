We just released sabre/uri 2.0. The sole change in this package is that it now
requires PHP 7 and has typehints where appropriate. Upgrading should be
seamless.

Both 1.x and 2.x will be maintained and receive bugfixes.

To upgrade sabre/uri, make sure your `composer.json` requires "^2.0" for
sabre/uri and run `composer update`.
