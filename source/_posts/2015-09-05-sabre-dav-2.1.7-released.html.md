We just released sabre/dav 2.1.7 

This release fixes an issue related to `MOVE` requests. If a `MOVE` request
was going to overwrite an existing resource, but that move request was stopped
by access control (or other plugins), the target resource would still be
deleted.

Update sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
