We just released sabre/dav 3.2.2. This release fixes a regression introduced
with sabre/dav 3.2.1 related to CardDAV synchronization.

At the very least Em Client was affected by this.


To upgrade sabre/http, make sure your `composer.json` requires "^3.2" for
sabre/dav and run `composer update`.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
