We just released sabre/http 3.0.4.

This release fixes a small bug that made it impossible to support multiple
authentication schemes at the same time (for instance supporting both Basic
and Digest at the same end-point).

Updating is only required for people that want to use this feature.

Upgrade sabre/http by running:

    composer update sabre/http

If this didn't upgrade you to 3.0.4, make sure that your composer.json file
has a line that looks like this:

    "sabre/http" : "~3.0.4"

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1].
