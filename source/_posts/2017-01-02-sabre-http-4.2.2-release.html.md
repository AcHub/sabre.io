Happy 2017!

We just released sabre/http 4.2.2. This release adds a workaround for several
broken HTTP client implementations, that send invalid `Content-Length` headers.

This should improve general compatibility with no further side-effects.

To upgrade sabre/http, make sure your `composer.json` requires "^4.2" for
sabre/http and run `composer update`.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
