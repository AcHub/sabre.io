We just released sabre/dav 3.1.2. This release contains the following changes:

* A small issue with cleaning up sync logs after deleting addressbooks. This
  could potentially cause a CardDAV client to miss an update.
* A fix for supporting non-seekable streams, for those that have custom `IFile`
  implementations with non-seekable streams.
* Faster XML parsing and generating due to an update to sabre/xml.
* Updates to the sqlite schema to make it more strict.
* Better parsing of some `RRULE` properties.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.
