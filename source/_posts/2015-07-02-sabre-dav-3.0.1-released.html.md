We just released sabre/dav 3.0.1.

This release fixes several small bugs. These bugs could allow for a minor
corruption in some stored properties, and fixes an infinite loops, which could
be exploited as a denial of service attack.

Updating is highly recommended.

Update sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
