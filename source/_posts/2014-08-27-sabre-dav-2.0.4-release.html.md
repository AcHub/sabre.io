We just released sabre/dav 2.0.4.

This releases has a number of improvements, namely:

1. PostgresSQL files have been corrected. Note that while we ship postgres
   files, it is not an officially supported database.
2. After nodes are deletes, locks were not automatically removed. This was
   problematic, because re-creating a node could cause it to be locked
   instantly. This is now fixed.
3. There were some problems with both the default Cal- and CardDAV PDO
   backends, when the 'Sync' plugin is not enabled. This is now resolved.

Upgrade sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.
