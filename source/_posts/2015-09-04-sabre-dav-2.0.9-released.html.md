We just released sabre/dav 2.0.9 

This release fixes an issue related to `MOVE` requests. If a `MOVE` request
was going to overwrite an existing resource, but that move request was stopped
by access control (or other plugins), the target resource would still be
deleted.

The zip release also updates sabre/vobject from version 3.3.5 to 3.4.6, which
also fixes a number of bugs.

Update sabre/dav by running:

    composer update sabre/dav

Or download the zip from the [releases][2] page.

Full changelog can be found on [Github][1]
