A lightweight library for event-based development in PHP.

This library brings two patterns that are common for event-based development
in javascript to PHP.

The two patterns are:

1. [EventEmitter][1], which is a very lightweight "Publish and Subscribe" pattern.
2. [Promises][2], which is a design pattern to improve chained asynchronous callbacks.
